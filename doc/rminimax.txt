rminimax (https://gitlab.inria.fr/sfilip/rminimax) is a tool to generate
minimax rational approximants with some constraints.

To install it, it needs several dependencies (see README.md file).

Once one has built rminimax, one can do for example (check with revision
c9c30b0 of rminimax):

$ ./ratapprox --function="erf(x)" --dom=[0.5,1.769] --num=[x,x^3] --den=[1,x^2] --weight=1 --output=x1p.sollya --log

and one gets in the x1p.sollya file:

$ cat x1p.sollya
Numerator = [|
0x1.22d187c88a59fp+0,
0x7.bb56e81b5014p-8|];
Denominator = [|
0x1p+0,
0x6.2af020486fb6p-4|];

Useful tips for CORE-MATH:
* with --weight=1 one minimizes the absolute error, without any --weight option
  the default is to take the inverse of the function, which minimizes the
  relative error.
* with --dispCoeff=[bin|dec|hex] one controls the output of coefficients
* use --numF=[DD,D] --denF=[DD,D] to have a double-double for the degree-0
  coefficient (by default coefficients are double)
